# learning_notes
* If you don't know how to set the environment for python, open the file "how_to_install" first.
* The learning materials will be written in ~.ipython.
* If i have chance to finish some projects later, the files will be written in ~.py.
* Most materials comes from two books:《Python与量化投资：从基础到实战(王小川)》and 《利用Python进行数据分析(第二版)》.
* The file "how_to_install" comes from "小象学院", i will delete the file if anyone argues that this is tort.
